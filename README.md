## Components

### Frontend

The frontend component is responsible for user interaction. It provides a web interface for adding, deleting, 
and editing categories and posts, as well as for viewing the list of categories and posts.

The backend component handles all requests from the frontend and performs database operations. 
It is responsible for adding, deleting, and editing categories and posts, as well as retrieving
